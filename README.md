# Bunker Extension
A version of [Bunker](https://github.com/pukmajster/bunker) but in an extension format.

## Chrome?
At this moment in time, Bunker is only compatible with Firefox and there were many changes made in order to allow support for Firefox. 

## What changes did you make?
Changes include (but are not limited to) **stripping of the integrated configuration editor and the stripping of the Steam games extension**. The configuration editor had to be moved to an entirely new page due to the painstaking work required in order to port this over. I also removed the Steam integration because I created this for myself and I'm not exactly fond of the feature myself.

## Where can I find release files?
You can find releases for Bunker Extension [here](https://ci.bean.codes/danny/bunker/-/releases).
